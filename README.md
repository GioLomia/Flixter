## Flix Part 1

### User Stories
A user story is a way to capture requirements for an app from an end-user perspective. It is a common practice in app development and helps to simplify the way requirements are specified.
#### REQUIRED
- [X] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [X] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [X] In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.
